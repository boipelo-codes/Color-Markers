# Color-Markers🌈

Hey there,👋🏾

This file has the HTML and CSS for creating color markers. This activity is to reinforce your knowledge on CSS and a bit more practise for your divs and using correct class selectors from your html. 
I really hope this helps and don't forget to check out freecodecamp for lessons on your coding journey!

Wishing you all the best!✨
